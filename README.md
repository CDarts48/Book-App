# Book-App Description

Our desktop book app is designed to allow users to search the title of any book and get the book description, author, and a link to Google Books to preview the book. This app uses the Google Books API for the description, author, and Google Book link. Then uses the Open Library API for the titles. For styling, we used a CSS framework called CSS Reset to create a polished UI. 


# Future Development

There are still a couple of issues we are running into. In book descriptions, apostrophes are displayed as their ASCII code instead of " ' ". Our local storage is almost where we want it, but instead of creating an array of previous searches, it only shows the last search.
